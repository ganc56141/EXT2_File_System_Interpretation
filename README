Included in the tarball are:
    README
    Makefile
    lab3a.c
    ext2_fs.h
    

lab3a.c: the lab file. It reads an on-disk file system and outputs some analysis on its contents. 

Makefile:
    default: creates lab3a executable
    dist: create the tarball with first UID
    clean: returns to untarred state



--- Remarks ---

The most difficult part, by far, was understnaidn the file system and calculating the offsets. The implementation of the parsing functions was relatively straightforward.
